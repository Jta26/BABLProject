## **Pitt Mobile App Challenge**

### **Code It**


BABL is a Simple, Clean, and User-Friendly app coded in Java for Android Devices. Itâ€™s core functionality is based around helping Pitt students of all campuses meet and connect with other students, for the purpose of speaking or learning to speak bilingually. BABL acts as means of increasing cultural understanding and intellectual diversity on campus by attempting to diminish communication barriers between students. 

Target market: Our target market is Android Users at the University of Pittsburgh that speak or want to speak bilingually.

Pitch:  BABL is unique because it ties Pitt Usernames to Facebook accounts, and uses that as means of connection and communication. It matches users up together that speak the same language, and are on the users chosen campuses.

BABL utilizes the idea of matching, and the publicly available Facebook profiles to help students get to know other people based on which language they wish to speak. What makes BABL awesome is the tech behind the scenes. It has fully featured Facebook Integration, Asynchronous Tasking, Password Encryption, and User Data Storage using Microsoft SQL Server.
